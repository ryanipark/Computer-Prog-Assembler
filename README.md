**These text files are full output dumps of each program, I used retrieve jobs to download the job from IBM z/OS.**

## ASSIGN3C
This program uses simple subtracted and explicit addressing to store the result into storage, then dumps the storage for the user to view.
## ASSIGN6
This program works with input from a file on employee data, processing their hours, pay rate. It then uses arithmitic to display gross pay, federal/state withholding and net pay. All while keeping running totals to display to the user.
## ASSIGN7
Very similar to program ASSIGN6, but this program prioritizes better formatting.
## ASSIGN8
This program utilizes bitmasks to output employees information accordingly, it also involves the use of packed decimal fields. 
## ASSIGN9
This is by far the most extensive program written that piggy backs off of the previous. It is the most well written and formatted program. This program can read and process large quantities of employee data if it the input meets this criteria:

This program does the following:

 - Uses subroutines to break up code
 - Involves the use of bitmasks that can display 18 bit output fields
 - Stores and uses information stored into a Table
 - Calculates averages of all employees information
